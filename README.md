Web APIs code quiz challenge
This week's homewor challenge required us to build a quiz app.

Made sure that when the start button is clicked.
The timer starts & you are presented with the first question.
When the question is answered, you are then given another question.
If a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds is subtracted from the clock
if all questions are answered or of the timer reaches 0
the quiz is over.
Once the quiz is over you can view,s ave, and submit your score. You can also view high scores.
